Let me know what you think, Wilson :)

You can make any changes that you'd like, I included line comments which should be fairly self explanatory if you want to add/remove content. If you want any extra changes or need fixes I'd be happy to help.

You can also add your email in the HTML contact form section, just replace the "mailto:yourcompany@example.com" with your email.

Good luck with your company!
